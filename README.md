### FULLY CODED COMPONENTS

Now UI Flutter features over 100 variations of components like buttons, inputs, cards, navigations etc, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining, 25 example pages and 5 plugins. All components can take variations in colour, that you can easily modify inside our theme file.

You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code, because all elements are implemented. We wanted the design process to be seamless, so switching from image to the real page is very easy to do.
